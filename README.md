# Yandex praktikum messanger project

This is a messanger project done by Ilya Zabolotny in terms of Yandex.Praktikum Middle Frontend Developer course.

Primarly inspired by [Telegram](https://web.telegram.org/) and its features.

The project is built using handlebars template engine, sass and css modules.
It's built around two main classes: Block and EventBus, which allow the implementation of 'reactive-components'.

```
npm start - build project and start server
npm run dev - start development environment
npm run build - build project
```
